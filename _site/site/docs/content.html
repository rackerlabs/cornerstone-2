<h2 id="our_content">Our Content</h2>

<p>Rackspace.com content has three primary goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Differentiate Rackspace from other industry players.</strong> Rackspace has the broadest, most integrated product portfolio in the industry. Our content makes that market differentiation crystal clear.</li>

<li><strong>Make it easy to buy.</strong> We have around 10 seconds to capture a visitor’s interest. Rackspace.com content communicates our value proposition and products with exceptional clarity, and then guides customers through the interest-to-purchase cycle.</li>

<li><strong>Enable self-service.</strong> Customers tell us that they often want self-service options over live interaction. (Who really wants to sit on the phone?) Our content enables customers to quickly and easily self educate.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a keeper of Rackspace web content, keep these goals in mind when you write. If you receive a request to develop content that doesn’t align with these goals, question it!</p>

<h2 id="our_writing">Our Writing</h2>

<p>On the Rackspace.com team, we don’t just take the content that a subject matter expert sends us, fix the grammar and typos, and say we’re done.</p>

<ul>
<li>We probe to discover what our customers care about.</li>

<li>We ask questions when concepts don’t make sense.</li>

<li>We research new technologies that we’ve never encountered before.</li>

<li>We turn tech specs into compelling conversations.</li>

<li>We eliminate redundant content.</li>

<li>We make sure every page is a complete experience.</li>

<li>We don’t over- or under-estimate our readers’ technical expertise.</li>

<li>We clearly explain Rackspace’s product portfolio, and show how products and services fit together.</li>

<li>We help customers choose custom solutions that meet unique needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, we’re not just editors—we’re skilled content developers who care deeply about customer experience. Internalize that approach, and remember it as you write.</p>
