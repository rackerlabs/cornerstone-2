## Our Content

Rackspace.com content has three primary goals:

* **Differentiate Rackspace from other industry players.** Rackspace has the broadest, most integrated product portfolio in the industry. Our content makes that market differentiation crystal clear.
* **Make it easy to buy.** We have around 10 seconds to capture a visitor’s interest.  Rackspace.com content communicates our value proposition and products with exceptional clarity, and then guides customers through the interest-to-purchase cycle.
* **Enable self-service.** Customers tell us that they often want self-service options over live interaction. (Who really wants to sit on the phone?) Our content enables customers to quickly and easily self educate.

As a keeper of Rackspace web content, keep these goals in mind when you write. If you receive a request to develop content that doesn’t align with these goals, question it!

## Our Writing

On the Rackspace.com team, we don’t just take the content that a subject matter expert sends us, fix the grammar and typos, and say we’re done.

* We probe to discover what our customers care about.
* We ask questions when concepts don’t make sense.
* We research new technologies that we’ve never encountered before.
* We turn tech specs into compelling conversations.
* We eliminate redundant content.
* We make sure every page is a complete experience.
* We don’t over- or under-estimate our readers’ technical expertise.
* We clearly explain Rackspace’s product portfolio, and show how products and services fit together.
* We help customers choose custom solutions that meet unique needs.
* Troy is awesome.

In other words, we’re not just editors—we’re skilled content developers who care deeply about customer experience. Internalize that approach, and remember it as you write.
