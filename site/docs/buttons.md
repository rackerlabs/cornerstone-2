##Primary Buttons


Primary buttons are one of two types of buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Primary buttons are used for very important actions, like getting started. 

###When to Use

+ Use primary buttons when they are the primary call to action for a user on the page. 
+ Ex: When directing a user to sign-up for a service.

###How to use

+ Ensure the text declared in the primary button is explicit in informing the customer the task they are embarking upon. 
+ Ex: "Get Started" clearly tells the user they will begin performing the task the page is designed for.

###Design Rationale

+ Including a button for the customer to click-on frames that they will be moving through a process.
+ It prepares the customer for a user interaction that will call a model or move to a page designated for the call to action to which the button is intended.
+ The button is lightened upon interaction instructing the user has hovered over an element that can be interacted with.


###Example

<div class="col-1of2">

<p>Primary Button</p>

<div class="primary-button"><p class="source-sans">GET STARTED</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Primary Button onHover</p>

<div class="col-1of2 last">

<div class="primary-button" style="background-color:#DD2233"><p class="source-sans">GET STARTED</p>

</div>

</div>

<br />

###Code Sample

`Include the class name`

`Include any other relevent code`

<div class="dividing-bar">

</div>



##Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons is the second type of buttons used on Rackspace.com properties. Secondary Buttons are used for less important user-oriented actions, like learning more. 

###When to Use

+ Use secondary buttons when they are representing a secondary action for a user on the page. 
+ Ex: When directing a user to learn more about a service prior to performing a primary action.

###How to use

+ Ensure the text declared in the secondary button prompts the user with optional content.
+ Ex: "Learn more" asks the customer with optional information allowing them to easily decide if they need to interact with the button.

###Design Rationale
 
+ A secondary button provides the user with a different pathway to engage with our site.
+ Secondary buttons are valuable for providing a user with additional context prior to making a purchase decision.
+ Ex: Mary was not ready to sign up for Managed Cloud and wanted to know more about the service. When she clicked the learn more button on the Managed Cloud page, she was provided an indepth case study on the value managed cloud provided her.

###Example

<p>Secondary Button </p>

<div class="secondary-button"><p class="source-sans">LEARN MORE</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="col-1of2 last">

<p>Secondary Button onHover</p>

<div class="secondary-button" style="border: 2px solid #333;"><p class="source-sans">LEARN MORE</p>

</div>

</div>

`Include any other relevent code`

##Play Button

Play buttons provide access to embedded video content. Videos help show our customers complex information through voice and visuals.

###When to Use

+ Play buttons should be used when video content will help a customer make an informed decision.
+ Ex: Roger was unsure how the Cloud Servers product could benefit him. He saw a video button providing a demo of the product. By consuming the video he was able to understand how creating a server was performed through the Rackspace control panel.

###How to use

+ Play buttons should contain a background image containing a screen capture of the video that will be played when clicked.
+ Videos can be played within the current page or through linking to a new page that houses the video content.

###Design Rationale
 
+ The button visual style mimics a playhead and informs the customer this is video content.

	<p>Play button</p>

##Dropdown
Dropdown buttons allow the use

###When to Use

###How to use

+ Dropdown buttons can be established based on the onHover or onClick interactions paradigm depending on page.
+ onHover will generally be used in header level content allowing a customer to navigate more complex IA structures.
+ onClick is generally used when allowing the customer to trim a view and only access relevent information.
+ Build in the required interaction (onClick / onHover) based on the dropdown type and include

###Design Rationale

+ A dropdown menu allows a page to contain a multitude of links while not muddying the content of the page.
